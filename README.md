# Riven Bot for Discord
> Source code for Riven Bot

This repository has all the source code that makes the Riven Bot work. Destiny 2 is a very famous game created and developed by Bungie game studios. The idea is to have a Discord bot that contains very useful utilities for D2 players that use Discord as their main social media platform like retrieving weekly-rotation information for in-game activities and player-specific raid/dungeon statistics.
