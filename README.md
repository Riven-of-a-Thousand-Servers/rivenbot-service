# Destiny 2 Bot Service
Server-side project that will power the APIs the user-interface of the Discord bot will use
___
- [ ] First objective is to get items for a character in a presentable way. Most of what Bungie's APIs offers is highly customizable to whatever someone needs.
  - So far, we've gotten the hashed versions of all the items for a character in a REST API. Need to use the Destiny 2 manifest to get human-readable output from those hashes.
