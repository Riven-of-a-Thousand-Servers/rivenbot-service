# Riven of a Thousand Servers for Discord
> Source code for Riven of a Thousand Servers Discord Bot

This repository has all the source code that makes Riven of a Thousand Severs work. Destiny 2 is a very famous game created and developed by Bungie game studios. The idea is to have a Discord bot that contains very useful utilities for players like myself like retrieving weekly-rotation information for in-game activities, player-specific raid/dungeon/nightfall statistics, and Vendor information using _Discord messages only_. Ther most important reason for this project though, is to help melearn and understand deeply modern JVM-based technologies as well as their benefits and trade-offs.
