# Riven Bot for Discord
> Source code for Riven Bot

This repository has all the source code that makes the Riven Bot work. The idea is to have a Discord bot that contains very useful utilities for D2 players that use Discord as their main social media platform like retrieving weekly-rotation information for in-game activities and player-specific raid/dungeon statistics. 

## Why? 
Because I can and I want to learn through projects that I find fun and challenging.

Any information regarding versions of specific dependencies you can find it in the `build.gradle` file at the root directory of the project

You can invite Riven to your server ~[here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1177030727678820362&permissions=274877966400&integration_type=0&scope=bot)~ **Riven will be back soon! We're in the process of moving infrastructure somewhere else.**


## Raid Stats
So far the bot has limited functionality and the focus of the next releases will be to polish out the `/raid_stats` command, improving the time it takes to load hundreds, even thousands of raid reports to calculate the numbers for an individual player, as well as adding filters to the command itself if the user would prefer to narrow down their search to only one raid at a time. 

Here's a small demo of how the Raid Statistics are utilized and presented when using RivenBot:

## Contributing
This is meant to be a personal-project, therefore any issues or suggestions are appreciated but the development of the bot is under my responsibility and of selected trusted individuals. If you have an awesome idea for this bot, you can open a 
GitHub issue; that way we can discuss the idea further.
